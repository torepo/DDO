# DATA BASE OBJECT FOR DUMMY

First of all, I want to say that this project is only intended for learning. Not for the purpose of production. I'm a beginner so please understand if you found many mistakes anywhere in my code, and of course for that I need your suggestion, comment and advice.

The main priority of this project is to try to simplifying writing PHP code for access to the database. For this purpose I use PDO capability, and is currently adding three custom object, those are the object database, table and query.

The reason why I try to create this project is because I feel lazy to write code that I think long enough. So I was wondering if there is a shorter and simpler way to do it.

In addition, it is also a learning project for me to be familiar with OOP concepts especially in the PHP language.
OK, I just call this dabase object MyDDO. There is no meaning, just a name..

# MyDDO
