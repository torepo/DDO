# DATA BASE OBJECT FOR DUMMY

First of all, I want to say that this project is only intended for learning. Not for the purpose of production. I'm a beginner so please understandable if many mistakes anywhere in my code.

The main priority of this project is to try to simplifying writing PHP code for access to the database. For this purpose I use PDO capability, and is currently adding three custom object, those are the object database, table and query.

The reason why I try to creat this project is because I feel lazy to write code that I think long enough. So I was wondering if there is a shorter and simpler way to do it.

In addition, it is also a learning project for me to be familiar with OOP concepts especially in the PHP language
