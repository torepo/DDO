# INTRODUCTION

First of all, I want to say that this project is only intended for learning and pleasure. Not for the purpose of production. I'm a beginner so please understand if you found many mistakes anywhere in my code, and of course for that I need your suggestion, comment and advice.

The main priority of this project is to try to simplifying writing PHP code for access to the MySql database. For this purpose I use PDO capability. 

The reason why I try to create this project is because I feel lazy to write code that I think long enough. So I was wondering if there is a shorter and simpler way to do it.

In addition, it is also a learning project for me to be familiar with OOP concepts especially in the PHP language.
OK, I just call this dabase object DDO. There is no meaning, just a name..

# REPOSITORY 

I create some folders in this repository so that files are well organized. Youn can view the full description for each folder on file [repository structure.md](https://github.com/torepo/DDO/blob/master/repository%20structure.md)

It should be noted, that I did this project step by step based on a task or solving problems that arise. So for that I create a folder called history. You can visit these folders if you want to know what the task is being done, the problem is happening.
